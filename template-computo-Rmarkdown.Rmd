# Introduction

## About this document

This document provides a Rmarkdown^[https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/] template for contributions to the [Computo](https://computo.sfds.asso.fr/) journal. We show how `R` or `Python` code can be included.

## Advice for writting your manuscript

First make sure that you are able to build your manuscript as a regular notebook on your system. Then you can start configure the binder environment.

# Formatting

This section covers basic formatting guidelines using Rmarkdown. [Rmarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) is a simple formatting system for authoring HTML and PDF documents, that relies on the [Pandoc Markdown
](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_pandoc_markdown.html) markup language. 

To render/compile a document as HTML within Rstudio, click the **Knit** button. A document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded code chunks within the document.

## Mathematical formulae

[LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) code is natively supported, which makes it possible to use mathematical formulae:

$$
f(x_1, \dots, x_n; \mu, \sigma^2) = 
\frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2\pi}} \exp{\left(- \frac{1}{2\sigma^2}\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i - \mu)^2\right)}
$$

## Code

`R` code [@R-base] chunks may be embedded as follows:

```{r r-code, echo=TRUE}
x <- rnorm(10)
```

The R code from the other code chunks in this document has been hidden from the output, but is visible from the source document. 


It is also possible to include inline code. For example the mean of `x` is `r mean(x)`.

## Figures

Plots can be generated as follows:

```{r pressure, message=FALSE}
library("ggplot2")
p <- ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()
p
```

Interactive plots may also be produced in the HTML output of the document:

```{r, message=FALSE}
library("plotly")
ggplotly(p)
```

It is also possible to create figures from static images:

```{r figure-sfds, out.width="20%", fig.cap="SFdS logo (c.a. 2020).", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/sfds.png")
```

## Tables

Tables can be generated as follows:

```{r cars}
knitr::kable(summary(cars), caption = "Table caption.")
```

Other options for tables are listed [here](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-7.html).

## Bibliographic references

References are displayed as footnotes using [BibTeX](http://www.bibtex.org/), e.g. `[@computo]` will be displayed as [@computo], where `computo` is the bibtex key for this specific entry. The bibliographic information is automatically retrieved from the `.bib` file specified in the header of this document (here: `template-computo-Rmarkdown.bib`).

## Beyond R code

Other languages can be included in Rmarkdown documents, including python, Julia and C++. In particular, the R package [reticulate](https://cran.r-project.org/package=reticulate) [@R-reticulate] includes a Python engine for R Markdown that enables easy interoperability between Python and R chunks. We refer to the vignette [R Markdown Python Engine](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/reticulate/vignettes/r_markdown.html) for a more detailed description.
